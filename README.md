# Welcome to Mastery 2019!

For attendees of the two sessions on Python:

These are the `ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) session files for Mastery 2019. In order to maximize the value of the session it is critical to follow along and get hands-on experience with the tools, techniques, and packages that we are going to be exploring together. Getting the environment and becoming somewhat familiar with Jupyter Notebook before your session will make for a much more pleasant and valuable experience. We want you to get the most out of your time!

## Preparation

Before the session:

* Have a Google account with access to https://colab.research.google.com/
* Have familiarized yourself with Google Colabratory's interface.
    * Review content on https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb# Try:
        * Navigating between cells
        * Executing cells
        * Modifying a bit of code in cells, and re-executing them
* Import files from this Github repository into your Colaboratory file structure.

If you get your stuff working, please help your fellow attendees if they're having trouble so that we can all follow along.

Thanks!
