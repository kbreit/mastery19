## Welcome to Mastery 2019

These are the `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook) session files for Mastery 2019 sessions:

* Intro to Python Scripting Language: Fundamentals
* Intermediate Python Scripting:Â Applications
* Introduction to AI

In order to maximize the value of the session it is critical to follow along and get hands-on experience with the tools, techniques, and packages that we are going to be exploring together. Getting familiar with and oriented in the Colaboratory/Jupyter Notebook environment before your session will make for a much more pleasant and valuable experience. We want you to get the most out of your time!
